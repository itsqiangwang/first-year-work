                I enjoyed the process of scrapping content off of the internet for this project. I enjoy working with this kind of "crowdsourced" content because there is a kind of honesty and rawness to them. And because they are honest, sometimes there is a humor, which I also apprecicate. I enjoyed taking this content and recontextualize them, but didn't really like the images that they were recontextualized with... Although I liked the tension that was created by juxtaposing "new" and "old", I feel like it lacked an impact or some kind of sincerity... I felt like I was pulling an old trick and sliding these images in just for the sake of the contrast of time.

I also like that we thoroughly (more or less) John's Morgan's work and made this poster into something that embodies John's own work in some way... It was a "lazy" strategy for not making decisions... We took everything he did and "averaged" them into a poster.

                What I appreciated the most in this project was the element of chance. Chance allows for generativity and this map can have endless permutations. I was also interested in how graphic design relates to walking, how graphic design (a map is a piece of designed artifact) can be an embodied experience, and how graphic design can be more than "reading" and also about choreography and movement. I didn't like that this turned out to be so instructional. It feels a bit rigid as something meant to activate a more dynamic, free-flowing relationship one might have with their immediate surrounding.

                Chance almost seems like an intuitive design choice for me. Sometimes when I don't want to make a decision I let chance decide. I like the sense of serendipity of coming across combinations that are not somewhat loosely linked. Chance allows me to lose the grip of control. It creates surprises. More than that, in this project involving excavating objects from my apartment's basement and examining them as mass-produced objects, I was interested in the narratives around these objects - how they are duplicates and seemingly share the same physical constructions but may be used in very different contexts and have unique stories around them by the people who use them... (this interest was not really articulated through this project and was something I struggled to express/articulate/examine at the time of its making, mostly because finding these narratives would be a painstakingly aruduous process. It'd probably involve a long period of accumulation...)

                This is a 24-hour clock that narrates the book The Hours, which has a plot line that takes place over the course of one day. One thing that I really enjoyed was this long (relatively) duration that is required to experience the work. I want to make more durational work... Work that requires patience and investment to experience. Work that changes so subtly and gradually and so incrementally. I also like that there is an element of chance in this work, too. You might visit this clock at say, 10 am and see one part of the book. Then leave and see the clock again at 3 pm, when it's cycling through another section of the book. I like the fact that no one can really experience this work in its entirely at once, but then because of this incompleteness, they might then be tempted to come back. I seem to enjoy building a kind of seduction into the work... To make it gestate in the minds of whoever comes across it.

                Looking back at this assignment where we were asked to pick a tool and make something out of it, I think what I enjoyed the most was some of the early explorations where I attempted to "misusing" the tool. I was working with a sewing needle and tried to make images with it by poking pixels/dots/lines/marks with it. I somehow ended up circling back to its function of "sewing" and got interested in image-stitching, and from there began exploring panorama images. My interests while working on the project were not focused at all and very much dispersed. Thinking about the panorama, I was then drawn to scroll paintings, particularly Chinese scroll paintings depicting landscape. And I thought about how those paintings never really depict the human body and wanted to subvert that tradition, so I reconstructed my own body as a queer body in a Frankeinstein sort of way. I liked the convergence of the work (a long scroll, depicting a mountain) and the location at which the work was shown (a staircase that required climbing). I liked that walking and some physical labor was required to experience the work... I felt hesistant about putting my body out there for people to see but there was a slight sense joy and satisfaction derived from being on display, of being seen...

                I'm obviously interested in building narratives. The element of chance in this one allows for a narrative that is not linear and always differently sequenced with each viewing. It has a similar quality with the 24-hour clock that i enjoy... There is a kind of awkward humor that I don't dislike... There is an element of psychodrama with this one that I also enjoy... a kind of psychological portrait/reflection of this nebulous web of thoughts of Yale students...

                I think a recurring thing in my work is this infinite-ness and generativity enabled by chance... That seems to be a gesture that comes up often. I had made a book earlier last semester appropriating a legal document attempting to amend lgbtq+ rights, and with this project I appropriated a document of slang terms compiled by the FBI... I find some kind of satisfaction from working with these government documents, too...

                this was a quick project in response to Jack Halberstam's Queer Art of Failure... I was done overnight and made partially for the number count for spring's final review... I was criticized for the work not really engaging with the text but a mere surface-level kind of aesthetic interpretation of the writing... I still mind that critique. But.. what I enjoyed about this one was this approach to making a "childish" font... by writing with my left hand... There is a humor and cleverness in there that I think is worth extracting...

                A anthology of queer literature. I liked the approach of not showing the images and instead use descriptions of them... There is a tension between wanting to resurface these writings and images vs concealing them... I also really enjoy appropriating existing tools to make things that were intended by its use... Minimizing a window as a way to make a typeface...
